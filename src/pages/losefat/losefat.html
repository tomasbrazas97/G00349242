  <h3>Tip 2: Commit to Sleep</h3>
  <p>Sleep is another underrated part of a proper fat-loss program. If you aren't sleeping enough, your insulin sensitivity will decrease, which means that hormone will 
    be less effective at shuttling glucose from your blood into cells, where it belongs. So what does your body do? It pumps out more insulin, still hoping to finish the job.
    The problem is that insulin is also a fat-storage hormone.
    Since your cells will be starved for glucose also means you'll encounter carbohydrate cravings and lousy workouts.
      
    Few healthy food choices are made after midnight. Going to bed an extra hour early is also a perfect way to combat night-time eating, which can be disastrous to your progress.</p>

  <h3>Tip 3: Switch to Single-Ingredient Foods</h3>
  <p>Tip to remember that will dramatically help you improve the quality of your diet is to only eat single-ingredient foods.
      You'll immediately cut out all the processed, unhealthy foods that can quickly put a stop to weight loss and have you feeling unwell.
      Single ingredient foods are in their most natural state and will contain the most nutrition to help keep your body healthy throughout the weight-loss process.

  <h3>Tip 4: Increase Protein Intake</h3>
  <p>Increase your ptein intake by 10-20%. A higher protein intake is the next step to seeing enhanced fat loss. Not only will 
    protein-rich foods calm hunger pangs, but they also have a higher thermogenic effect as well. Thermo-what? Well, for every 
    100 calories you eat, your body will burn about 20-30 percent of those calories off simply breaking down the food. This means
    you will net fewer calories increasing caloric deficit. The higher the deficit, the greater the fat loss is. Protein also reduces the chance
    of muscle loss and helps maintain fast metabolism long-term.
