    <h2>Strength Training</h2>
    <h3>Below are tips that will improve your strength goals</h3>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Tip 1: Use Free Weights and Compoun Movements</h3>
    <p>
        To be strong and huge, your workouts must rely on a Greek god's
         exercises: <b>squat, bench press, deadlift, military press, rows, power cleans, and other variations of these movements.</b> 
         They recruit the largest amount of muscle mass.Free weights require you to stabilize the load and allow weights to be moved 
         exactly as the body is designed to move them. Since the trainee is controlling every aspect of the movement, every aspect of it is being trained.

    <h3>Tip 2: Technique</h3>
    <p>
        The seasoned expert is always working on technique, whereas your average Joe isn't too concerned about improving. Increasing strength is a neuromuscular venture, a skill.
        By improving and practicing technique, the nervous system becomes more efficient at telling muscles to work. Additionally, improving technique helps prevent injury.

    <h3>Tip 3: Low Repetition Range</h3>
    <p>
        For fast increases in strength, we must force the nervous system to cause increased force production, which is best done in the 1 to 5 rep range. Higher than that, and your 
        nervous system will start focusing on other areas. Avoid cumulative fatigue to reach peak strength levels.

    <h3>Tip 4: Increase Resistance</h3>
    <p>
        If you don't attempt to add weight to the bar at every training session, then your body has nothing to adapt to.
        This doesn't mean adding an extra 45-pound plate each set; in fact, smaller jumps in weight translate into consistent progress. 
        Compromising movement technique and integrity for more weight won't produce results. In addition, recording your training sessions
        on a piece of paper or a notebook will help you keep track of progress.

    <h3>Tip 5: Supplement Wisely</h3>
    <p>
        You should be taking things to augment nutritional gaps such as multivitamins, fish oil, and protein. Remember to include nutrients that are congruent with getting stronger.
        Creatine is one of the most studied supplements out there, and should be included in any program for someone who wants to increase strength and muscle size.
        If a muscle is subjected to the correct stimulus with sufficient intensity, it will grow stronger and larger. Just make sure to give your divine body plenty of rest and food. 
        Train simply, train less, and train intense for consistent results.
