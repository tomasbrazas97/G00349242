    <h2>Flexibility</h2>
    <p>Flexibility may not be noticable on a person on first glance, 
      but it is very important for basic daily movements like moving around or reaching for something.
      The goal is to improve range of motion throughout the body. You don't need to dedicate
      classes for this but at the end of a workout couple stretches will improve your
      flexibility over-time.

      <b>Below listed are all different types of flexibilty training.</b>

    <ion-item>
      Static Stretching
    </ion-item>
    <p>
        You move into a position that lengthens a target muscle and hold the position for 15-60 seconds. It's best to remember to breathe as you hold each stretch.
      </p>

    <ion-item>
      Dynamic Stretching
    </ion-item>
    <p>
        You move in an out of a position that lengthens a target muscle. Dynamic stretches often involve a gentle bouncing movement and are sometimes called ballistic stretches.
    </p>

    <ion-item>
      Active Isolated Stretching
    </ion-item>
    <p>
        You move your joint through a complete range of motion, holding the endpoint only briefly, then return to the starting point and repeat. Many athletes and active exercisers use active isolated stretching to prevent injuries or muscle imbalance.
