    <h2>Aerobic Metabolism and Endurance</h2>
    <p>
        Most often it's a combination of energy systems that supply the fuel needed for exercise, with the intensity 
        and duration of the exercise determining which method gets used when. However, aerobic metabolism fuels most 
        of the energy needed for long duration or endurance exercises.

        Athletes continually strive to push their capacity to exercise harder and longer and increase their endurance. 
        The factors that limit sustained high-intensity efforts include fatigue and exhaustion. Sports training has been 
        shown to modify and postpone the point at which this fatigue occurs.

    <h2>Muscle Fiber Type and Endurance</h2>
    <p>
        High-level endurance athletes often have a higher proportion of slow twitch (Type I) muscle fibers. These slow twitch 
        fibers are more efficient at using oxygen (and aerobic metabolism) to generate more fuel (ATP) for continuous, extended 
        muscle contractions over a long time. They fire more slowly than fast twitch fibers and can go for a long time before they 
        fatigue. Therefore, slow twitch fibers are great at helping athletes run marathons and bicycle for hours.

    <h2>Adaptations to Endurance Training</h2>
    <p>
        With endurance training, the body becomes better able to produce ATP through aerobic metabolism.

        The cardiorespiratory system and aerobic energy systems become more efficient at delivering oxygen to the working muscles and 
        converting carbohydrate and fat to energy.

    <h2>Enduranec Training Programs</h2>
    <p>
        There are many different ways to train for improved aerobic endurance. The duration, frequency, and intensity of each type of 
        training vary and the training focuses on slightly different energy systems and skills and results in different physical adaptations. 
        Some of the most well-known endurance training programs include:

    <ion-list>
      <ion-item>
          Long Slow Distance Training
      </ion-item>
      <p>
          This type of training is the most common type of endurance training and the foundation for marathon runners, long-distance cyclists, and other sports that demand long, sustained steady energy outputs. It is also the easiest form of endurance training for new or novice exercisers.

      <ion-item>
          Pace/Tempo Training
      </ion-item>
      <p>
          consists of training at a steady, but fairly high intensity; just slightly higher than "race pace" for a shorter duration, usually 20-30 minutes at a steady pace.
      </p>

      <ion-item>
          Interval Training
      </ion-item>
      <p>
          consists of short, repeated, but intense physical efforts (3-5 minutes followed by short rest periods).
      </p>
      
      <ion-item>
        Circuit Training
      </ion-item>
      <p>
          consists of a series of specific exercises performed for a short duration and rotated through in quick in succession with little or no rest in between. Traditional circuit training routines build both strength and endurance and can be varied in a multitude of ways to meet any athlete's training goals.
      </p>

      <ion-item>
        Fartlek Training
      </ion-item>
      <p>
          combines some or all of the other training methods during a long, moderate training session. During the workout the athlete adds short bursts of higher intensity work with no set plan; it's up to how the athlete feels.
