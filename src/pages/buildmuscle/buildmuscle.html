    <h2>Building Muscle</h2>
    <h2>Here are some tips to maintain and build muscle</h2>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Tip 1: Train Under An Hour</h3>
    <p>
        You should be keeping whichever program you are doing to no more than 1 hour of duration. Be sure that you are focusing on keeping the 
        intensity high rather than making the workout drag on. Plus, there's no research that says marathon training sessions are better for muscle
         growth. Focus on keeping your rest periods under a minute and limit the small talk with other gym members.

    <h3>Tip 2: Eat Enough </h3>
      <p>You need to consume more calories than you burn each day and therefore will make your body grow.
      Consume at least 20 calories per pound of bodyweight you weigh to gain muscle mass.

    <h3>Tip 3: Eat Sufficient High-Quality Protein</h3>
    <p>Consuming sufficient high quality protein is essential for building muscle. Current
      recommendations are to consume a minimum of 0.8g of protein per each kg of body weight. Experts say 
      1.5g-2g of protein is required. Below is a list of high quality protein foods.

    <h3>Tip 4: Don't Let Stress Ruin Your Goals</h3>
    <p>
        You may not know it, but stress kills muscle gains dead. Catabolic hormones such as cortisol, 
        which are released during times of stress, can quickly put the brakes on muscle growth. In fact, 
        stress can be the number one progress killer. Arguments at home, long stressful hours at work, missed meals, lack of sleep, 
        and general chaos all contribute to stress and cortisol release. Try and make sure you get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.
        It's vital that you sort out your stress levels and ensure that you stay as calm as possible.

    <h3>Tip 5: Advantage of Post-Workout Period</h3>
    <p>
        Fuelling your body correctly after training is critical in your quest for more muscle - so be sure to consume a suitable recovery drink 
        as soon as possible following your workout. A combination of carbs and fast digesting proteins (such as whey protein) is the ideal post workout 
        nutrition. Providing protein after your exercise session will help to support gains in muscle mass. Consume carbs and fast-absorbing whey protein after exercise.
